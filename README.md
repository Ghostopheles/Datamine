# Datamine

An addon designed to make in-game data more accessible by reducing barriers around the availability of certain data.

Example:

### Slash Commands

Datamine's base command is `/dm` or `/datamine`.

- `help` - Gives you some help.
- `item <itemID>` - Dumps the item info for the given `itemID` to the chat frame. Data for certain items may not be visible in-game.
- `spell <spellID>` Same as above but for spells. Data for certain spells may not be visible in-game.
- `questline <uiMapID> [<questID>]` Provides information about questlines on a given map ID, and optionally, the questline a quest belongs to.

More commands are available in-game and can be viewed with the `/dm help` command.

### Roadmap

These are things I want to add, subject to change, might get scrapped, yadda-yadda. Items marked with 🤠 are things I've already built, but still need to port over to this addon.
