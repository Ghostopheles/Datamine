# Datamine v1.1

##### Added
* Added `/dm soundkit`, `/dm soundfile`, and `/dm mog`. Check `/dm help` for more information on these commands
* Added the beginnings of my custom model viewer
    * Currently only supports one-at-a-time ItemModifiedAppearanceID entries
    * In the future, will support viewing CreatureDisplayIDs, models by FileDataID, and much more
* Begun work on a settings system for some user configuration
