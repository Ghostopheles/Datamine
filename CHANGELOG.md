# Datamine 2.4.5

#### Added
- Tooltips for the 'is this appearance collected' icons on the model viewer's transmog set panel.
- ruRU localization, courtesy of Hubbotu/ZamestoTV

#### Removed
- Removed the 'transform' tab on the model viewer.
    - I felt this tab wasn't necessary, and it probably didn't even work.

#### Fixed
- Fixed an error that would be thrown if a transmog set contained an invalid source ID.
