# Datamine v2.4.0

#### Fixed
* Cleaned up the `Datamine` Lua namespace a bit, not use-facing but I don't care
* Replaced deprecated function calls
* Updated the 'danger' conditions for the quick reload keybind to be less malicious
* An issue that caused the frame to take up the entire screen when playing at low resolutions
* Model preview data for store items now correctly updates when the model does

#### Added
* A toggle for tooltip customizations
* Item AppearanceIDs and ItemModifiedAppearanceIDs can now be enabled for item tooltips
* Quest ID can now be shown on various quest tooltips and map pins
* The Datamine UI is now fully resizable
    * This may result in weirdness with some UI elements, will try to iron that out in the future
* Maps for 11.0.7.57788

#### Removed
* Alien
* The popup for loading map data
