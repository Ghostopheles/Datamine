# Datamine v2.4.0

#### Fixed
* An issue that caused the frame to take up the entire screen when playing at low resolutions

#### Added
* A toggle for enabling tooltip customizations
* The Datamine UI is now fully resizable
    * This may result in weirdness with some UI elements, will try to iron that out in the future
